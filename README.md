# library-rest

### Create a RESTful web service for a Library. The service must have the following API endpoints:
- (C)reate a new Book
- (R)ead existing Books
- (U)pdate an existing Book
- (D)elete an existing Book

#### A Book entity has the following properties:
- Author (mandatory)
- Title (mandatory)
- ISBN (mandatory)
- Release Date

#### MUST HAVE Requirements (we will not consider your submission if these are not met)
- Code must be covered with unit tests
- Clean, easy to understand and maintainable
- Be RESTful
- Validate inputs
- Avoid using frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Spring Boot) -- weâ€™d like to see all code written from the ground up to understand your abilities regardless of a framework.

### Bonus / Nice to have
- Endpoints covered with system/functional tests
- API documented (OpenAPI)
- Dockerize your application, i.e. besides the GitHub code repo please also host it and give us a demo link [you can use a trial account of AWS/GCP/Azure to do this]

##### Please Note
[1] You could choose to do this test preferably in NodeJS or PHP (no frameworks, only core PHP all code written from the ground up please).

[2] Provide a code you can be proud of, something that fully reflects your knowledge of development, unit testing, DevOps, scalability and security.

[3] We are not curious about if you know how to use existing frameworks, but weâ€™d like to assess your real coding skills.

##### If you feel the task takes too much time, implement only a part of it (like one or two endpoints only), but what you implement should meet every requirement from the must have list above.

> Hint: You can print this page out and use the Requirements paragraph as a checklist.
